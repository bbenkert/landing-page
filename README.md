# This is a landing page project from The Odin Project course.

## See this page live: https://bbenkert.github.io/landing-page/

### I am using:

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

What I have learned so far is that flexbox is very useful but sometimes tricky. You have to be careful when nesting sections and divs. This is a fun project.

### What's next?

- Make this page fully responsive
- Keep going. Learning is fun!
